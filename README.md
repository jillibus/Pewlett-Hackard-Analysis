## Overview
"Pewlett-Hackard is a large company boasting several thousand employees and it's been around for a long time.  As baby boomers begin to retire at a rapid rate Pewlett-Hackard is looking toward the future in two ways. First, it's offering a retirement package for those who meet certain criteria. Second, it's starting to think about which positions will need to be filled in the near future.  The number of upcoming retirements will leave thousands of job openings. What would happen to a company if they didn't look ahead and prepare for this many vacancies?  It probably wouldn't be pretty.  

Bobby is an up and coming HR Analyst whose task is to perform employee research. Specificially, he need to find answers to the following questions, Who will be retiring in the next few years, and how many positions will Pewlett-Hackard need to fill?  This analysis will help future-proof Pewlett Hackard by generating a list of all employees eligible for the retirement package.  The employee data Bobby needs is only available in the form of six CSV files because Pewlett Hackard has been mainly using Excel and VBA to work with their data.  But now they've finally decided to update their methods and instead use SQL, a definite upgrade considering the amount of data.  Your task is to help Bobby build an employee database with SQL by applying your data modelling, engineering, and analysis skills."  _Module 7.0.4 Welcome to Pewlett Hackard_
